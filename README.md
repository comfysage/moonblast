# moonblast

An adapted version of [grimblast](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib/blob/33b38358559054d316eb605ccb733980dfa7dc63/grimblast/README.md).

## changes

- uses `xdg-open` by default as image editor (instead of gimp).

- squashed some bugs.

## installation

Install by running the Makefile or just copying the `moonblast` script in your
`~/.bin`
